View : Display area (can be of any type, text, image, animation...)
View Group : A larger display area that contains the smaller ones.
xmls : are used to describe how an app looks.
All targets should be atleast 48dp. (So that one can easily use them regardless of the device they are using it on )

LAyout weight : 

Relative Layout : relative to edges (left, right, top, bottom)
Resources: 
	android:id="@+id/USER_DEFINED_VALUE"
Padding and Margin :  add white spaces so that views are not just aligned around the boundaries of the screen.
Padding: can be general, like android:padding="5dp" or can be specific as android:paddingRight/paddingLeft/paddingBottom="5dp"
Padding gets handled by the view, margin by parent view.

The values should be multiple of 8dp (recommended)


To lookup:
